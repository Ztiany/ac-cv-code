Learning Step:

1. av-device: Learn how to use the get av-device.

5. chat-room: Learn how to use Socket.io to create a chat room (Socket.io will be the signaling server for WebRTC later).
6. local-media-transmission: RTCPeerConnection to RTCPeerConnection(Locally, without signaling server and stun/turn server). This is for us to learn use APIs of the RTCPeerConnection.
7. remote-media-transmission: RTCPeerConnection to RTCPeerConnection(Remotely, with signaling server and stun/turn server). This is for us to learn how to use the signaling server and stun/turn server.
